		<h4> ExploreCourses description </h4>
		<p>
		This project-based course provides an introduction to game design covering topics like 2D/3D Art, Audio, User Interfaces, Production, Narrative Design, Marketing, and Publishing. Speakers from the profession will provide relevant context during a weekly seminar. Weekly assignments include in-depth materials and require students to independently create small video games. Classroom meetings will be used to foster student project discussions, and deepen understanding of material. The course culminates with students forming project teams to create a final video game. Assignments will be completed within the Unity game development engine; prior Unity experience is not required. Given class size limitations, an online survey will be distributed before class starts and students will be selected so to achieve a diverse class composition. </p>

		<h4> Course Goals </h4>

		We want you to have the opportunity to work with talented peers, learn from world-class indie and AAA developers, and build a fun product by the end of the quarter.<br>
		<br>We hope that students find the skills they learn in CS146 to be broadly applicable whether they later choose to pursue academia, build a startup, join the games industry, or anything else. I also hope through CS146 students will develop a deeper understanding of products, design, and the people who enjoy them - a valuable complement to the technical skills they learn from other CS courses.<br>
		<br> We believe that product + design + teamwork is the key aspect of the course that remains valuable well into the future.  It happens that video games are an ideal medium and Unity is a flexible prototyping engine; however, my opinion is that learning these is a secondary goal compared to the primary objective of training product-minded engineers.

		<h4> Prerequisites </h4>
		<p>CS 106A or equivalent programming experience</p>
		<h4> Why can't I enroll in this class right now? </h4>
		<p>The online survey - as is discussed above - is the only way to apply to the class. We have set the enrollment limit to 0 and also have set a large waitlist cap. All students interested in taking this class should sign up for the waitlist. Note that being on the waitlist (as opposed to registered for the class) does not hurt your chances of getting into the class in any way. As long as you've done everything in the TODOs section above, you're good to go.</p>
