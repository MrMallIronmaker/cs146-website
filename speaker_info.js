		blurb: "We finally have a full quarter to work on a game at Stanford, "
		 + "so we must make the most of that time and carefully choose what "
		 + "we deliver.  We often get caught up with what we want to do, but "
		 + "it is more important to think about what we offer.  What do you "
		 + "want to stand out for?  Games are a subjective art, so it's not " 
		 + "easy to convince players why your game will be especially fun, let "
		 + "alone why they should choose to play.  Through various example "
		 + "games, we will explore the experiences they offer, the motivations " 
		 + "they satisfy and ultimately how well they execute on their promises.",
		intro:
		   "Stephen Lim is a lead producer at Riot Games.  He's worked in the "
		 + "game industry for over 13 years as a producer of new games for Riot,"
		 + " League of Legends, Project Titan at Blizzard Entertainment, Spore "
		 + "at EA and as a programmer on weapons for Ratchet &amp; Clank at "
		 + "Insomniac Games. Prior to games, he worked as a programmer at "
		 + "enterprise startups in Silicon Valley. He is a defender of multiplayer"
		 + " experiences and battles a never-ending tide of casual games."

		name: "Stone Librande",
		title: "One-Page Designs",
		blurb: 
		   "In an effort to communicate more effectively and concisely, "
		 + "Stone has been experimenting with a style of design documentation "
		 + "called a \"one page design\". As the name implies, this is a document "
		 + "that is exactly one page long. After all, why create a document with "
		 + "more than one page if most people only read the first page anyway? "
		 + "During this talk Stone will show numerous examples of one page "
		 + "designs from Diablo 3, The Simpsons Game, Spore, and SimCity. He'll "
		 + "discuss what works and what doesn't and explain how you can use "
		 + "similar techniques to communicate key design ideas to your team.",
				
		intro:
		   "Stone Librande, a Lead Designer at Riot Games, has worked in the "
		 + "game industry for over 15 years on games such as SimCity and "
		 + "Diablo 3. In addition to his full-time job designing video games, "
		 + "he also teaches game design courses at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s "
		 + "ETC program and runs design seminars around the world. An avid game "
		 + "collector, Stone's walk-in closet holds more than 300 card and "
		 + "board games, including 30 that he has designed himself."

		blurb: 
		   "Unity is a powerful and easy to use game engine. In this talk, "

		 + "using Unity. We'll walk through many of the key pieces of the "
		 + "engine as we build a small, playable prototype. By the end of this "

		 + "making your own projects with Unity as well as have a broad "
		 + "vocabulary of the pieces needed to make a game.",
